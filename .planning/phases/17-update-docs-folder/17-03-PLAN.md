<objective>
Update ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, and DEVELOPMENT.md for v1.1 accuracy.

Purpose: Complete docs folder update by adding lifecycle architecture diagrams and ensuring all docs reflect current v1.1 state.
Output: Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with lifecycle diagrams, README.md with v1.1 highlights, DEVELOPMENT.md with new packages.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update ARCHITECTURE.md with lifecycle diagrams</name>
  <files>docs/ARCHITECTURE.md</files>
  <action>
Update ARCHITECTURE.md with v1.1 lifecycle architecture:

1. Update System Overview diagram to include lifecycle and state:
   - Add "Lifecycle (Executor)" box between CLI and Workflow layers
   - Add "State (Manager)" box connected to Lifecycle

2. Update Layer Diagram:
   - Add lifecycle layer between CLI and Workflow
   - Show state package as a support layer

3. Update Package Dependencies diagram:
   - Add lifecycle package: cli → lifecycle → workflow
   - Add state package: cli → state
   - Show lifecycle depends on router for GetLifecycle()

4. Add new "Lifecycle Execution Flow" diagram (after Queue Processing):
   - Show complete flow: Get Status → Get Lifecycle Steps → Loop (Run Workflow → Update Status) → Done
   - Include error handling: On Failure → Save State → Exit
   - Show resume path: Load State → Continue from step

5. Add new "State Persistence" diagram:
   - Show state file location, save/load flow
   - Atomic write pattern (temp + rename)

6. Update "Key Interfaces" section:
   - Add lifecycle.WorkflowRunner interface
   - Add lifecycle.StatusReader interface
   - Add lifecycle.StatusWriter interface
   - Add lifecycle.Executor type with Execute method

     <verify>grep -q "lifecycle" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md && grep -q "state" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md && grep -q "Lifecycle Execution" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md</verify>
     <done>ARCHITECTURE.md has lifecycle diagrams, state persistence section, and updated package dependencies</done>
     </task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update README.md and DEVELOPMENT.md</name>
  <files>docs/README.md, docs/DEVELOPMENT.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md for v1.1:
1. Update Quick Start example to show lifecycle behavior:
   - Note that `run` executes full lifecycle to done
2. Update Commands Overview table to reflect lifecycle behavior
3. Update Architecture Overview diagram to match ARCHITECTURE.md changes

Update DEVELOPMENT.md for v1.1:

1. Update Project Structure tree:
   - Add internal/lifecycle/ directory with executor.go
   - Add internal/state/ directory with state.go
2. Update package descriptions if needed
3. Verify "Adding a New Package" guidance is still accurate
   </action>
   <verify>grep -q "lifecycle" docs/README.md && grep -q "lifecycle" docs/DEVELOPMENT.md && grep -q "state" docs/DEVELOPMENT.md</verify>
   <done>README.md reflects v1.1 behavior, DEVELOPMENT.md includes lifecycle and state packages in structure</done>
   </task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md has Lifecycle Execution Flow diagram
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md has State Persistence diagram
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md package dependencies include lifecycle and state
- [ ] README.md reflects v1.1 lifecycle behavior
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT.md project structure includes lifecycle and state packages
- [ ] All diagrams are consistent across docs
- [ ] No broken markdown links
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- ARCHITECTURE.md fully documents v1.1 architecture with diagrams
- README.md quick start reflects lifecycle execution
- DEVELOPMENT.md structure includes all current packages
- Phase 17 complete - all docs folder files updated for v1.1
  </success_criteria>
