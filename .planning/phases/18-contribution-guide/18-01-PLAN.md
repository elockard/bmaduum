<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update CONTRIBUTING.md for v1.1 architecture</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect v1.1 architecture:

1. Update Project Structure section to match docs/DEVELOPMENT.md:
   - Add lifecycle/ directory (executor.go, executor_test.go)
   - Add state/ directory (state.go, state_test.go)
   - Add router/ directory (router.go, lifecycle.go, router_test.go)
   - Add status/ directory (reader.go, writer.go, status_test.go)

2. Update Package Guidelines section:
   - Add lifecycle: "Full story lifecycle execution from status to done"
   - Add state: "State persistence for error recovery and resume"
   - Add router: "Status-based workflow routing"
   - Add status: "Sprint status file reading and writing"

3. Update Testing Guidelines - Mocking section:
   - Add lifecycle.WorkflowRunner interface example
   - Add status.Reader and status.Writer interface examples
   - Keep existing claude.Executor and output.Printer examples

4. Add Architecture Overview section (brief, link to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md):
   - Mention CLI -> Lifecycle -> Workflow -> Claude flow
   - Reference docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed diagrams

Do NOT change: Getting Started, Development Setup, Building, Running Tests, Code Quality, Code Style, Pull Request Process, Reporting Issues, Feature Requests sections - these are already correct.

<verify>grep -q "lifecycle/" CONTRIBUTING.md && grep -q "state/" CONTRIBUTING.md && grep -q "router/" CONTRIBUTING.md && grep -q "status/" CONTRIBUTING.md</verify>
<done>CONTRIBUTING.md has all v1.1 packages in Project Structure and Package Guidelines</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</name>
  <files>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</files>
  <action>
Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md using the Contributor Covenant v2.1 (standard for open source projects):

1. Use full Contributor Covenant 2.1 text
2. Replace [INSERT CONTACT METHOD] with: "opening a GitHub issue"
3. Include all standard sections:
   - Our Pledge
   - Our Standards
   - Enforcement Responsibilities
   - Scope
   - Enforcement
   - Enforcement Guidelines (with 4 levels)
   - Attribution

This is the standard Code of Conduct used by major open source projects (Kubernetes, Rails, Swift, etc.).
</action>
<verify>test -f CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md && grep -q "Contributor Covenant" CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md && grep -q "2.1" CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</verify>
<done>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists with Contributor Covenant v2.1</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add Code of Conduct reference to README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Add Code of Conduct reference to README.md:

1. In the Contributing section (line ~290-293), add reference to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:
   - After "Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines."
   - Add: "Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating."

2. Optionally add a Contributor Covenant badge near the top (after the title):
   ```markdown
   [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
   ```

Keep the rest of README.md unchanged - it was already updated for v1.1 in Phase 17.
</action>
<verify>grep -q "Code of Conduct" README.md && grep -q "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" README.md</verify>
<done>README.md references CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</done>
</task>
